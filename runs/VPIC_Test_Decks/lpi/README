4. Problem v_04

This problem is derived from an LPI, Laser Plasma Interaction, input deck from
Brian Albright. It uses periodic boundary conditions which allows for better
load balancing which in turn makes it easier to interpret performance results.
The single node mesh is 136x32x32 which should be small enough to fit in the
16 GB of HBM on a Trinity KNL node. Using scaling factors, it can be scaled up
in size to provide a problem which uses a larger percentage of the DDR memory
on a single node. The mesh has a factor of 17 and factors of 2 which makes
possible running the same problem on Trinity Haswell and KNL nodes or any
compute node where the number of cores on a processor has factors of 2 and at
most a single factor of 17. This problem uses an electron species and two ion
species with a target of 512 particles per cell per species. It has a number of
configurable parameters.
