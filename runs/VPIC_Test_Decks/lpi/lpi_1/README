This set of input files is designed to allow for strong scaling studies of
an LPI problem on Trinity Haswell, Trinity KNL and CTS1 Broadwell nodes.  As
a consequence, the grid dimensions has factors of 2, 17 and two factors of 3.
This particular setup allows for a strong scaling study up to 8 nodes.
